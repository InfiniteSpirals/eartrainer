1. MVP

-	Multiple categories (/folders)
-	Add / remove from library
-	Auto cue items
-	Randomise file start point (assume 15s minimum?)
-	Track EQ points chosen, focus more on the audible range


2. Phase 2

-	Build out UI
-	Game Engine (React)
-	Menu Engine	(React)
-	Refactor all logic, Typescript+ES6

-	Auto-categorise tracks?
-	Manage library
-	Parameterise game settings and UI
-	Visualisation / 3D bits
-	DB integration / Analytics / Progress over time

3. Public!?!

- More modes
- User Accounts
- Online / Head2Head (can we get that running off docker with some sort of sync service!?)
- Rewrite for serverless??
